Problem Statement: Automated restoration of torn documents using image processing.
Run Tabpage.py, has lots of libraries. So almost impossible to run, unless
PyQt4, OpenCV, numpy etc. are available. Binaries will be made available
soon. If not, mail me(thisisma08@gmail.com) to get the binaries.

My contribution to the project was the GUI (Tabpage.py) and the backend code
related to OverlappingArea
